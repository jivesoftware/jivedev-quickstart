# Jive Custom View Tile Builder

You can easily create a Jive Custom View Tile Integration using this form that auto-generates the package for you (in the form of a Jive add-on). All you need to do is write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets and paste it in. Once you have the add-on package, you can upload it to your Jive community.
